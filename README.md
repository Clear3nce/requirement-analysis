# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
- this repository focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements

## What is Requirement Analysis?
- Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
- Clarity and Understanding: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
- Scope Definition: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
- Basis for Design and Development: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
- Cost and Time Estimation: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
- Quality Assurance: Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

1. Requirement Gathering

- Involves collecting high-level requirements from stakeholders, users, and clients.

- Focuses on understanding what the customer needs and expects from the system.

- Usually done through interviews, surveys, questionnaires, and observation.

- It is the starting point of the requirements engineering process.

2. Requirement Elicitation

- Goes deeper than gathering by exploring and uncovering hidden or unstated requirements.

- Uses techniques like brainstorming, prototyping, workshops, and use case scenarios.

- Encourages collaboration between stakeholders and analysts to clarify expectations.

- Helps reveal conflicts, ambiguities, and assumptions in initial inputs.

3. Requirement Documentation

- Converts gathered and elicited requirements into structured and formalized formats.

- Creates artifacts such as Software Requirements Specifications (SRS), user stories, and use cases.

- Ensures consistency, clarity, and traceability of all requirements.

- Serves as a reference for developers, testers, and stakeholders throughout the project.

4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling

- Involves examining and organizing requirements to identify gaps, redundancies, or conflicts.

- Uses models like data flow diagrams (DFDs), entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs), or UML.

- Categorizes requirements into functional and non-functional types.

- Helps stakeholders visualize system behavior and system structure.

5. Requirement Validation

- Ensures that documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs.

- Typically involves reviews, walkthroughs, inspections, and requirement traceability matrices.

- Aims to detect errors, omissions, and inconsistencies early before development starts.

- Validated requirements reduce rework, save time, and improve project success.


## Types of Requirements
### Functional Requirements


### Non-functional Requirements
